## MIT Media Lab - Recreating the Past - Class 4: Odili Donald Odita

The MIT Media Lab class - Recreating the Past - explores a number of influential artists who have, over the past century, added their own unique perspective on computational art. Each week focuses on a new artist and through exploring their view point and recreating their artworks I hope to gain a valuable window into their thought processes, helping me learn how to express my own opinions through computational art. 

## Odili Donald Odita

In the forth week of Recreating the Past the focus is on patterns. Three main artists were covered in detail: Anni Albers (a master of textiles and weaving), Bridget Riley (a fine artist leveraging intricate patterning and optical illusions) and finally Odili Donald Odita with his powerful viewpoints on Color and it's effects on humanity and society.

I chose to spend this week diving into Odili Donald Odita's works as their bright and contrasting textures created detailed and complex spaces to be explored. Here is an excerpt from Odili's website, in his own words: (https://www.odilidonaldodita.com/statements/index.html)

“Color in itself has the possibility of mirroring the complexity of the world as much as it has the potential for being distinct.”

The organization and patterning in the paintings are of my own design. I continue to explore in the paintings a metaphoric ability to address the human condition through pattern, structure and design, as well as for its possibility to trigger memory. The colors I use are personal: they reflect the collection of visions from my travels locally and globally. This is also one of the hardest aspects of my work as I try to derive the colors intuitively, hand-mixing and coordinating them along the way. In my process, I cannot make a color twice – it can only appear to be the same. This aspect is important to me as it highlights the specificity of differences that exist in the world of people and things.

## Mamba Negra

Mamba Negra was a temporary Mural exhibit at the ICA in Miama.
